The year is 2020, a deadly virus has spread across the planet forcing society into a lockdown... and people still want to flock to the beach.

Your only hope is to reach the water and escape the mainland via boat.

Controls
--------
- **Move Left**: A / Left Arrow
- **Move Right**: D / Right Arrow
- **Jump**: Space Bar

How To Play
-----------
You must reach the end of the map and get in the boat before the time runs out. 

Should you make contact with an enemy, you will be taken to the encounter screen where you will need to type the on screen message within the allotted time to win. If you fail to type the message in time or make too many typos, you will take damage and lose one HP

The enemies, items and encounter conditions are randomly generated at the start of each game; don't count on the same placements every time (minus a few that are guaranteed to be there!).

Collectable Items
-----------------
**Energy Drink**: Provide a 50% boost to walking speed for 10 seconds
**Coin**: Provides a score bonus
**Stopwatch**: Adds an additional 20 seconds to the time limit
**Heart**: Restores 1 HP
